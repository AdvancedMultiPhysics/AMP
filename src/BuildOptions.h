/*! \page BuildOptions  AMP configure options
  This page provides a list of the different compile options for AMP.
  AMP is configured using cmake and the order of the options for cmake does not matter.

  \par AMP external package options
  AMP is designed to leverage a number of external packages.
  While most external packages are optional, some functionality will be lost if compiling without
  a given package.  All external packages can be built through the TPL builder.
  The required and optional packages can be specified with the TPL_LIST_REQUIRED and
  TPL_LIST_OPTIONAL flags.  By default only STACKTRACE is required and all other external packages
  are optional.  If a package is not specified by either flag (or the default) then it is not
  included.
  The current list of external packages is: <BR>
  MPI: MPI provides parallel capabilities for AMP.  If used, there are a number of additional
     optional flags that are used to configure MPI: <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "-D USE_MPI_FOR_SERIAL_TESTS=" indicates that we want to use mpi
            to run the serial tests in ctest.  Default is false. <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "-D MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG:STRING=" the flag to specify the flag mpi
            uses to specify the number of processors.  Default is "-np"<BR>
  LAPACK/BLAS: Lapack/Blas libraries that are used by many external packages. <BR>
  TRILINOS: Trilinos is used throughout AMP to provide additional functionality.
     It is used but not required within LinearAlgebra, Operators and Solvers.
     Compiling without Trilinos will result in reduced functionality.  <BR>
  PETSC: Petsc is used throughout AMP to provide additional functionality.
     It is used but not required within LinearAlgebra, Operators and Solvers.
     Compiling without Petsc will result in reduced functionality.  <BR>
  LIBMESH: LibMesh is required for the Operators package.  It is currently used within Mesh
     for additional functionality.  <BR>
  STKMESH: stk::mesh is currently used within Mesh for additional functionality.  <BR>
  SUNDIALS: <BR>
  HYPRE:<BR>
  NEK:<BR>
  MOAB:<BR>
  DENDRO:<BR>
  SILO:<BR>
  HDF5:<BR>
  NETCDF:<BR>

  \par Additional compile flags
  "-D COMPILE_MODE=":  Required string indicating if we are building in "debug" or "optimized mode".
  <BR>
  "-D AMP_DATA=":  Required path to the amp data directory.  <BR>
  "-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER="  Optional flag indicating the C compiler to use.  <BR>
  "-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="  Optional flag indicating the CXX compiler to use.  <BR>
  "-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER="  Optional flag indicating the Fortran compiler to use.  <BR>
  "-D CFLAGS="  Optional flag indicating additional flags to pass to the C compiler <BR>
  "-D CXXFLAGS="  Optional flag indicating additional flags to pass to the CXX compiler <BR>
  "-D FFLAGS="  Optional flag indicating additional flags to pass to the fortran compiler <BR>
  "-D LDLIBS="  Optional flag indicating additional flags to pass to the linker <BR>
  "-D TEST_MAX_PROCS="  Optional flag indicating the maximum number of processors for the tests
  (default: 32) <BR>
  "-D USE_STATIC="  Optional flag indicating if we are only using static libraries (default: false)
  <BR>
  "-D USE_FORTRAN="  Optional flag indicating if we want to include the fortran compiler (default:
  true) <BR>
