/**
  A class for representing the linear operator for linear/nonlinear mechanics.
  In the case of nonlinear mechanics, this operator will result from the
  linearization (or some approximate linearization) of the nonlinear operator.
  This class can be used to compute the finite element (FE) stiffness
  matrix corresponding to the mechanical equilibrium equations for a
  solid body. This class only deals with the volume integration,
  the boundary conditions are handled separately by the boundary operators.
