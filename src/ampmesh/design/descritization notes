Mesh:








FE:

nodal variables
gauss point vectors

element, node, face iterators (with/without ghost)

element-node connectivity
node-element connectivity
etc

shape functions (lagrange, hermite, etc.) (independent of mesh), need element shape (cube, etc), 
derivatives, jacobian, normals, areas/volumes

function evaluation - needs shape



Finite difference
5-points




DOF Map:
map index from iterator to memory index
Probably contains the iterators - needs to know about mesh, descritization, user defined ghost width, ...



Mesh Cretion
Mesh Decomposition 
Discretization        Solver
Data
Re-decompose
