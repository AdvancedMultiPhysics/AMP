/**
 * \class AMP_MPI
 *
 * @brief Provides C++ wrapper around MPI routines.
 *
 * Class AMP_MPI groups common MPI routines into one globally-accessible location.
 * It provides small, simple routines that are common in MPI code.
 * In some cases, the calling syntax has been simplified for convenience.
 * Moreover, there is no reason to include the preprocessor ifdef/endif guards around
 * these calls, since the MPI libraries are not called in these routines if the MPI
 * libraries are not being used (e.g., when writing serial code).
 * Note: Many of the communication routines are templated on type.
 * When using unknown types the reduce calls will fail, the send and gather calls
 * should succeed provided that the size of the data type object is a fixed size on
 * all processors.  sizeof(type) must be the same for all elements and processors.
