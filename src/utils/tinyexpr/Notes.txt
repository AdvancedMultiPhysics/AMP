TinyExpr is a very small recursive descent parser and evaluation engine for math expressions. It's handy when you want to add the ability to evaluation math expressions at runtime without adding a bunch of cruft to you project.  In addition to the standard math operators and precedence, TinyExpr also supports the standard C math functions and runtime binding of variables.
