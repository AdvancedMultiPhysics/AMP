# Introduction #
The Advanced Multi-Physics (AMP) package is an open source parallel object-oriented computational framework that is designed with single and multi-domain multi-physics applications in mind.  AMP can be used to build powerful and flexible multi-physics simulation algorithms from lightweight operator, solver, linear algebra, material database, discretization, and meshing components. The AMP design is meant to enable existing investments in application codes to be leveraged without having to adopt dramatically different data structures while developing new computational science applications. Application components are represented as discrete mathematical operators that only require a minimal interface and through operator composition the incremental development of complex parallel applications is enabled. AMP is meant to allow application domain scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians to simulate, collaborate, and conduct research on various aspects of massively parallel simulation algorithms.
